# Pogadajmy o Agile

## About:

The Pogadajmy o Agile website was developed for a client and serves as a dedicated platform for an Agile-focused podcast. The website introduces the podcast hosts and showcases the latest episodes by integrating with the Spotify API. This feature allows new content to be displayed automatically, ensuring visitors always have access to the most recent episodes. Building this website strengthened my ability to communicate effectively with both the client and the designer. By thoroughly defining the client’s needs and collaborating closely with the designer, I ensured that the final product aligned with the client's vision. Through multiple meetings and iterative feedback sessions, I was able to deliver a website that met the client’s expectations.
